        </h3>
        <p>
            Waste-Watt Solutions offers 02, 04, 06 & 08 yard waste containers with clean, straightforward contracts. We believe that the key to good business is committing to a long term relationship, which is why we strive to be as reliable, affordable, and consistent as possible. For ensuring you have an optimal location selected for your dumpster, please ensure that all dumpsters have a solid level surface for placement and that it is easily assessible via our trucks. Any enclosures should allow at least 6 inches of space from all sides of the dumpster.
