            Mission Statement:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The goal of Waste-Watt Solutions is to provide the world with an energy solution alongside a waste solution. Currently, funding for the project takes place amongst investors that have a similar vision as to the client and aims to be the first environmentally friendly trash incinerator. Currently, word of mouth with selective investors has been the main avenue of advertising, with advertising expanding to the masses near the first incineration facility with a radius of 50-100 miles. Advertising will ramp up as well in other areas to expand facilities and the message of what the client is hoping to do.
